## Why Git?

-   Replaces "filename" as a version control system

-   Microsoft Office "Track Changes"

    -   Comments and changes are either all in, or all out

    -   Only one file at a time

    -   Nonexistent for spreadsheets

-   Git

    -   Full history of changes

    -   Comments

    -   Possible to revert
